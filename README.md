‘Haley’ is a one-stop destination for an individual’s complete health monitoring that tracks the most common symptoms in its core. We are designing and implementing a web application which enables a user to record their medical history. Through this platform, we will ask users questions & based on their response, we give them predictions about what ails them. The idea is to develop a reliable and accessible platform that gives user-health advice such that they can avail home remedies and over the counter solutions if the waiting period for GP appointment is long.
Additionally, the users will be given a list of General Practitioners based on their location from whom they can get a professional opinion. ‘Haley’ is a health monitoring application that keeps a track of common symptoms to contain the future outbreak by making citizens aware of the impact based on data and sound reasoning such that we can send out an alarm if a lot of people report the same issue in a period of time. Given we aim to make the app accessible to all kinds of user groups; we aim the app to reach everyone.
