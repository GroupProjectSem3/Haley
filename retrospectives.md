## Project Retrospective Board - Sprint 4


## Liked / Glad ##

* Daily scrum calls
* Planned the tasks with respect tod different components of the project
* Devoted member and team level concern for a common cause. 
* Good at organising the stories
* In detail project management with Zenhub and very seamless communication in between members

## Learned ##

* Be more patient and understanding
* Started exploring the new technologies
* Exposure to working in a virtual team
* How to co-ordinate in a group and respect each individual's work and listen to everyone's view point

## Lacked / Mad ##

* Nervous about delivering an enterprise level working model of Haley in the given span of time
* As of now, in MongoDB atlas there is a limit of storage to 512MB in Free tier
* No proper computing resources to process heavy data

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* More refined structure
* A sponsored domain to host the Webapp, Amazon DynamoDb storage for 250 GB, AWS Lambda for around 5 Million hits per month, Amazon S3 for 50 GB storage.
* Face to face team discussion is not possible
* Early stage guidance with respect to how to work in an enterprise level project



## Project Retrospective Board - Sprint 5


## Liked / Glad ##

* Enthusiam of the team to work
* Weekly recording of our work
* Tracability matrix
* Planned the Zenhub board with product backlogs, sprint backlogs etc
* Implemented the POC for one of the functionality and almost good to go ahead.
* Good progress with respect to both front end and back end developmet

## Learned ##

* How to write reseach summary
* How to tackel challanges
* MongoDb functionalities, Enterprise Level Software Architecture, Traceability Matrix, TransloadIT API among others
* Exploring some of new concepts in the technology (python) to achieve the required output

## Lacked / Mad ##

* Open source level projects introducing similar features as our app
* Since worked on the local workspace, not too many commits done to github

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* More reading material
* Meeting the team in person instead of a second lockdown.

## Action Items ##

* Going to work directly on the main workspace/branch.
* Maintaining all the work/tasks in zenhub board, burning the estimates and achieving them as per the process
* We are going with Mongodb Atlas with free tier as the defalut memory storage is sufficient for now
* Rotating scrum master - really drive people to close the stories people have worked on.
* Full scope and epics (with high level estimates) for all remaining work
* Velocity report and Burndown chart for the week
* Look for more reading material and talk to people

## Project Retrospective Board - Sprint 6


## Liked / Glad ##

* Interim insight into our project.
* Redirect our project plan to prioritize how to proceed next.
* Learnt how our vision of Haley is coming into reality.
* Structured product development.
* Many story points covered.

## Learned ##

* How to write interim report.
* Working with technologies for employability in the upcoming months.
* Research on Web Technologies.
* Learnt to convert architecture to a technical solution.
* Research on proposed model which is a combination of convolution neural networks and Bayesian posterior distribution.
* Prioritize the report to more interactive than just technical in nature.

## Lacked / Mad ##

* Structured approach to make a documentation of an ongoing product development.
* Prioritizing of coding and documentation simultaneously. 

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* More time to submit the interim report and presentation with weekly video recording and demo of our app.
* Timely submission of our project.

## Action Items ##

* We took a break from work together and then focussed back on the problem (delay) at hand to provide a quality work.
* Redistributed work both report and code among the team instead of one person handling one thing only (at the end we did everything together as one team).

## Project Retrospective Board - Sprint 7

## Liked / Glad ##

* Made some UI changes to the main pages
* Designed the new landing page, login and register pages
* Structured product development.
* Many story points covered.
* Constructive feedback from the supervisors

## Learned ##

* Implemented the graphs concept with some javascript code in front end page to show results.
* Saving and loading of neural network model for transferable learning
* Use of proper architecture for implementation
* Importance of user evaluation

## Lacked / Mad ##

* Prioritizing the front end related work items.
* Integration of functionalities with the front end

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* Integrating the backend code with model to fetch the results is still in progress

## Action Items ##

* Started another approach to the model code for fetching the predictions.
* Distributed the pages among the team to achieve the front end work done.

## Project Retrospective Board - Sprint 8

## Liked / Glad ##

* Made some UI changes to the main pages.
* Many story points covered.
* Constructive feedback from the supervisors.
* Made a proper PoC with a user persona.
* Integrating the backend code with model to fetch the results has been achieved.

## Learned ##

* Implemented the graphs concept with some javascript code in front end page to show results.
* Saving and loading of neural network model for transferable learning. 
* Calling two APIs when one of them is in a steady stream and another in intermittent flow of data.
* Learnt how to use and implement different maps api's provided by google with multiple parameters.

## Lacked / Mad ##

* Amount of rework in the project.
* No issues closed on Friday.

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* Worked on few controls which took more time to bind it with backend code.

## Action Items ##

* Unit test cases.
* More interactive UI.
* Tried with alternative controls in the pages to achieve the same results.
* Hyperparameter tuning of the nn model.
