* Exposure to working in a virtual team
* How to co-ordinate in a group and respect each individual's work and listen to everyone's view point

## Lacked / Mad ##

* Nervous about delivering an enterprise level working model of Haley in the given span of time
* As of now, in MongoDB atlas there is a limit of storage to 512MB in Free tier
* No proper computing resources to process heavy data

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* More refined structure
* A sponsored domain to host the Webapp, Amazon DynamoDb storage for 250 GB, AWS Lambda for around 5 Million hits per month, Amazon S3 for 50 GB storage.
* Face to face team discussion is not possible
* Early stage guidance with respect to how to work in an enterprise level project

## Longed For/ Sad ##

* More reading material
* Meeting the team in person instead of a second lockdown.

## Action Iteam ##

* Going to work directly on the main workspace/branch.
* Maintaining all the work/tasks in zenhub board, burning the estimates and achieving them as per the process
* We are going with Mongodb Atlas with free tier as the defalut memory storage is sufficient for now
* Rotating scrum master - really drive people to close the stories people have worked on.
* Full scope and epics (with high level estimates) for all remaining work
* Velocity report and Burndown chart for the week
